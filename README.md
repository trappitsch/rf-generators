# rf-generators

Simple python/pyserial drivers to talk to plasma RF generators.
This is mainly a test project to learn how to work with these devices.
Ultimately, these drives should get incorporated into 
[instrumentkit](https://github.com/InstrumentKit/instrumentkit).

## RF Generators to test in here

- Dressler Cesar 1312, RS-232 model
- Comet Cito Plus 1310, RS-232 interface
